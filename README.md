# Clicky-Game

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## Dependencies

Created with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

- react
- react-dom
- react-scripts

## Requirements

### Create a new React application using Create React App:

- The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen.
- Each image should listen for click events.
- The application should keep track of the user's score.
- The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time.
- The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
- When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages.
- See the Create React App for instructions on [deploying](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) the application to Github Pages.

### In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
